I believe that designers of the future need to embrace technologies in their design process. The mission of the ID E-Lab is to make technology an accessible creative medium. Leverging my technical competency in electronics engineering and programming, I host several workshops on relevent topics to empower the design community in RISD.

Technical knowledge can be difficult to learn. In order for people to learn and practice in their own pace, I compile and consolidate all relevent resources and materials into well-organized websites as reference for students to go back after the workshop.

List of past workshops:
- [IoT with ESP32](https://github.com/RISD-ID-E-Lab/IDSB-IoT)
- [Driving motors with Arduino](https://github.com/RISD-ID-E-Lab/IDSB-Motors)
- [UI development with Flutter](https://github.com/RISD-ID-E-Lab/IDSB-UIDev)
